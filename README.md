# Neural-Networks-for-Machine-Learning-Coursera
This repository contains solutions to the Coursera course - Neural Network for Machine Learning taught by Geoffrey Hinton for the session : May-August 2017. It contains solutions to all programming assigments along with the data and help-code and instructions provided. Apart from the skeleton-code, all other code is self-written. 

The programming assignments have a perfect score on the tests on coursera. Apart from this, there are quizzes each week and also in-video short objective type questions. The course is a definite recommendation to anyone willing to develop a solid intuition into various ascpects of popular NN architecture. Also, it lays good groundwork for implementation of further advanced architectures because of "from-scratch" implementation approach to NN in MATLAB.
